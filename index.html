                        <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, (Italian: <em>“Leonardo from Vinci”</em>) (born April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France), Italian painter, draftsman, sculptor, architect, and engineer whose skill and intelligence, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.

                        His notebooks reveal a spirit of scientific inquiry and a mechanical inventiveness that were centuries ahead of their time.
                        He applied his creativity to every realm in which graphic representation is used: he was a painter, sculptor, architect, and engineer. But he went even beyond that. He used his superb intellect, unusual powers of observation, and mastery of the art of drawing to study nature itself, a line of inquiry that allowed his dual pursuits of art and science to flourish.

                        In the years between 1490 and 1495, the great program of Leonardo the writer (author of treatises) began. During this period, his interest in two fields—the artistic and the scientific—developed and shaped his future work, building toward a kind of creative dualism that sparked his inventiveness in both fields. He gradually gave shape to four main themes that were to occupy him for the rest of his life:
                    </p>                
                    <ul>
                        <li>a treatise on <strong>painting</strong>,</li>
                        <li>a treatise on <strong>architecture</strong>,</li>
                        <li>a book on the elements of <strong>mechanics</strong>,</li>
                        <li>a broadly outlined work on <strong>human anatomy</strong>.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>
                        Leonardo’s notebooks add up to thousands of closely written pages abundantly illustrated with sketches—the most voluminous literary legacy any painter has ever left behind. Of more than 40 codices mentioned—sometimes inaccurately—in contemporary sources, 21 have survived; these in turn sometimes contain notebooks originally separate but now bound so that 32 in all have been preserved.
