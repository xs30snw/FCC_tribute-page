# FCC_tribute-page

My solution for FreeCodeCamp challenge, where you create a tribute page as a part of [the responsive web design series](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). In this project I mainly use html and css, in order to hone project's accessibility and source readability.

The site was built with Webpack bundler. Html contains FreeCodeCamp's CDN for tests.
